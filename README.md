# About the Project
Tally Connect is a mobile and web application aimed at enhancing the student and community experience by connecting users with local events and volunteer opportunities in the Tallahassee area. Designed with students in mind, the app enables users to easily browse, sign up for, and participate in various activities. The platform provides comprehensive event details, including descriptions, dates, times, locations, and volunteer requirements.

Through Rattler Link, students and residents alike can stay informed about events in their city, and easily find ways to become more active in their local community. With a user-friendly interface, Rattler Link simplifies the process of discovering and joining events, whether for social engagement, or volunteering.
